# Parking Space Counter

This repository contains the source code and LaTeX documentation for a parking space counter developed using Python, OpenCV, and the face_recognition library. The project aims to automate the monitoring and counting of parking spaces in urban environments.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Utilizes computer vision techniques to detect vehicles within designated parking areas.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Provides real-time updates on parking space occupancy status.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Includes a user-friendly interface for visualizing parking availability.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluates system performance metrics such as accuracy and processing speed.

## Contents

- **`parking_space_counter.py`**: Python script for counting parking spots in video streams.
- **`parking_space_picker.py`**: Python script for selecting parking spaces from an image.
- **`park_positions.pkl`**: Pickle file storing parking space coordinates.
- **`main.tex`**: LaTeX documentation containing project report, including Introduction, Methodology, Implementation, Results, and Conclusion sections.
